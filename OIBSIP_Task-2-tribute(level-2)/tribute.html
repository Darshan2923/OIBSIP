            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in
                Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal
                Province in British India. Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā jananī (lit.'mother'), the anchor of
                family life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and
                the sixth son. Jankinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the
                government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. A self-made man from
                the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his
                village during the pooja holidays.What is Subhas Chandra Bose known for? Subhas Chandra Bose (also
                called Netaji) is known for his role in India's independence movement. A participant of the
                noncooperation movement and a leader of the Indian National Congress, he was part of the more militant
                wing and known for his advocacy of socialist policies.<br><a
